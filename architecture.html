      <h1>Architecture</h1>
      <p>I also love architecture and could go on about different styles all day, so in order to avoid that I'll share some pictures that I've taken on my vacations instead:
      <h2>Grand Place and Hôtel de Ville</h2>
      <p>
         <img src="assets/media/grandplace.jpg" alt = "Picture of the Town Hall and Grand Place - Brussels"/>
      </p>
      <p>
         This was taken at the town square in Brussels, Belgium. The town hall is built in a Brabantine Gothic style, characteristic of the Low Countries.
      </p>
      <h2>Beffroi de Bruges</h2>
      <p>
         <img src="assets/media/snapseed.jpg" alt = "Picture of the Belfry in Bruges"/>
      </p>
      <p>
         This is the famed Belfry of Bruges, Belgium. A mix of several different architectural styles–primarily Brabantine Gothic with some Flemish elements–this historic tower features heavily in the movie <strong>In Bruges</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>Interior of Sultanahmet Camii</h2>
      <p>
         <img src="assets/media/img24811.jpg" alt = "Picture of the interior of the Blue Mosque - Istanbul"/>
      </p>
      <p>
         This shows the ornate ceilings of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey–such intricate art and calligraphy is typical of Islamic architecture. This particular mosque was built in the Ottoman style, though it also features elements from it's Byzantine neighbor: Aya Sofya.
